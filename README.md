# SAS-Project
Project source for CalU Strike a Spark Conference 2019.
*This project is a functional proof-of-concept, laying the groundwork for future SAS web app groups; as such, it has little security.*

# Goal
The goal of this project was to facilitate collection & conclusion of scores from students' posters. Many manhours would be spent tallying and drafting results from the results; with this program, results would be made in seconds.

Judges would:
1. Sign in with a unique key assigned to them,
2. Select which poster they were judging, 
3. Select numeric scores from pre-determined ranges, as well as any comments,
4. Choose a submission action: 
   - Submit (Cannot be modified after) & Continue
   - Save (Scores can be re-loaded and revised at a later time) & Continue
5. Log out

# Results
There were successes with the event; the most success was proof that with revision, this could be a reliable and efficient method to save manhours tallying results.
